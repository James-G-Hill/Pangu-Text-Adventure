# PANGU: THE MYTH OF CREATION README #

In this game the player acts out the role of the Chinese mythical creature Pangue during the moment when he supposedly created the world.

### How does the game satisfy the requirements of the brief? ###

# The locked door #

The locked door is symbolised by the swirling void of ying and yang.
The player will find that they cannot go anywhere until they swing an axe to cut the ying and yang.
Cutting the ying and yang changes the environment, representing a movement from one to another.

# Hidden object #

The hidden object is the axe with which Pangu cuts the ying and yang.
The axe is hidden inside the remnants of the egg from which Pangu climbed.

# Incomplete object #

After the ying and yang is cut 4 creatures appear in the world:

	- The Turtle
	- The Qilin
	- The Phoenix
	- The Dragon
	
Pangue must bring the creatures together as a team to push the earth and sky apart.

# Limited resource #

The limited resource is time.
After 18,000 years Pangu will die.
Each action in the game represents 500 years.
If Pangu dies before the earth and sky are separated then the ying and yang will mix together again.
